# Airline overview dashboard

Support staff can open the dashboard page, enter an airline code, and see that airline's name plus
how many of its flights are currently active or scheduled, without writing any query themselves.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The dashboard page displays a search box for an airline code.
- Submitting a valid airline code shows the airline's name and a count of its currently active or
  scheduled flights.
- Submitting an airline code that doesn't exist shows a clear "not found" message instead of an
  error page or a blank result.
- The result is produced from a lookup against real airline/flight data, not hand-entered or mocked
  values.
